Hi! Thanks for purchasing my environmental pack! I hope that you will be satisfied.
If there should be any questions, feel free to email me exheavyone@gmail.com


All you have to do is drag the prefabs from the prefabs folder into your scene and let your creativity do the rest!

If you want to take a look at the scene I've created, double click the Sample Scene File and press 'Generate Lightning' in the Lightning settings to get a better look.
ADjust the lightning settings of your scene to your own preferences, in order to get your desired look! 
Feel free to message me up if you are a beginner and need advice!

If you would like to import nature assets into the scene, make sure to add the 'Standard Assets' from Unity to your project.
You can do that by selecting that option when creating the project or import them from the Unity Asset Store.




Have fun!
